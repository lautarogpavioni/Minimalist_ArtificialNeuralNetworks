The potential of artificial neural networks is explored in the classification of configurations of the Ising model. These ANNs are trained using an exceptionally simplified catalog of ideal configurations of the Ising model encompassing both order and disorder.  The generalization power of these networks to classify phases in complex models that are far from the simplified training context is put to the test.  As a paradigmatic case, the order-disorder transition of the diluted Ising model on several two-dimensional crystalline lattices, which does not have an exact solution and presents challenges for most of the available analytical and numerical techniques is analyzed.
